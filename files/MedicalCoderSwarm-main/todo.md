- for every patient, generate unique id, 
- for every doc in the database, attach some unique id, when we query the data using that id, 
- same patient can be handled differently, document from different year'
- for some docs, average doc size is 20+ pages, but others is 300+, biggest document is 30,000 pages, overview of the entire patient and medical history of the patient
- handle the number of pages
- turn around time, handle processes of 100+ pages, process 30,000 pages
